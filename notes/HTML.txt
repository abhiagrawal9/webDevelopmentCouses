	- Layout html elements

		- a (link) take href attribute which contains the url
		   	> use target attribute to open link in new tab, set target attribute to _blank

			> The target attribute can have one of the following values:
				_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
				_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
				_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
				_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

			> Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's 				  email program (to let them send a new email).
			  eg: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

			> link states in css are -> link, visited, hover, active
			  eg->. a:link, a:visited, a:hover , a:active

			> jump to other elements
			  eg-> <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a> where <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>

		     for eg : previous 300 x 200
			          new 100 x 66      
		   > We can also set only width and HTML will automatically adjust the aspect ratio 				 for us.

		   > With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.

				if (typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
  					// Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
				} else {
  					// Sorry! No Web Storage support..
